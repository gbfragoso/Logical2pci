# Logical2pci
This projects aims to receive an logical expression and, after some steps, convert this into pcode instructions.

# Steps
1. Catch the logical expression from input;
2. Running it in a pushdown automata;
3. Use result of step 2 to build a binary tree;
4. Run postorder transversal at btree to build reverse polish notation;
5. Convert RPN into valid Pcode instructions;
6. Run pcode and then generate output file;

# Compilation
> gcc -o teste ada2asa.c pcode.c rpn2pci.c btree2rpn.c pushdown.c main.c

# Running example
> ./teste "(1&(0|1))"

# Assumption
* For sucessful conversion the user must provide a balanced logical expression.
